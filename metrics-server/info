Metrics Server collects resource metrics from Kubelets and exposes them in Kubernetes apiserver 
through Metrics API for use by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler. 
Metrics API can also be accessed by kubectl top, making it easier to debug autoscaling pipelines.

Metrics Server is not meant for non-autoscaling purposes. 
For example, don't use it to forward metrics to monitoring solutions, 
or as a source of monitoring solution metrics.

in other word, metrics server is only for pod autoscaler, don't use it with prometheus.
it based sacle decision completely on
CPU/Memory and nothing else.
