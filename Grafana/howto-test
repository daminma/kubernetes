sometimes, the metrics that grafana use doesn't match the metrics that node-exporter use
for example, on grafana, i see metrics

node_memory_MemTotal

is used to memory, and no data is comming in, when i checked the node-exporter metrics

curl http://172.17.0.80:9100/metrics | grep node_memory_MemTotal 

i see

node_memory_MemTotal_bytes instead of node_memory_MemTotal

as soon as i change it to node_memory_MemTotal_bytes under edit-metrics, i see data comming in.
